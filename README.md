This is a small instruction of how to run the code in this repo:

Hopefully, you already have node.js, Postman and yarn installed at your machine;
Postman collection and code are in main;
Run the code by using: "yarn dev";
Check by using Postman: I can add by Postman if it's necessary;

I added postman collection into SwaggerHub, but it doesn't properly work so I think it's because of hosting it in local url.
Anyway, the link is here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/DANAKENGESSOVA_1/coffee-kata-SIS-back-end/1.0.0

If you have any questions - let me know.
